## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm (v8 or higher)
- MySQL database (local or remote)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nghiatran0401/carbon-credit-app.git
   cd carbon-credit-app
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables in `.env`:

   ```env
   # Database Configuration
   DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/carbon_credit"

   # Stripe Configuration
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."

   # Application URLs
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   ```

### Database Setup

1. Push the schema to your database:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```
2. (Optional) Seed the database with initial data:
   ```bash
   npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
   ```

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To launch the interactive Vitest UI:

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

Vitest will run all tests in the `tests/` directory, including full CRUD API tests, payment flows, and order history/audit trail.

## Types & Data Models

All main types/interfaces are defined in [`src/types/index.ts`](src/types/index.ts) and match the Prisma schema:

- `User`, `Forest`, `CarbonCredit`, `Order`, `OrderItem`, `ForestZone`, `Notification`, etc.

## Features

- Real-time order and payment status tracking (with audit trail)
- Admin panel displays full order history (status changes, payment events, failures, etc.)
- Real-time notification system with intelligent polling
- Comprehensive notification management with filtering and bulk operations

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — Start the development server
- `npm run build` — Build for production
- `npm start` — Start the production server
- `npm run lint` — Run ESLint
- `npm test` — Run Vitest tests
- `npm run test:ui` — Launch the Vitest interactive UI for running and debugging tests
- `npm run migrate` — Push schema to DB && Seed the database

## Testing

- All API routes are covered by Vitest tests in `tests/api/`
- Run `npm test` to execute all tests

## Admin Panel

- In the admin panel, each order row expands to show a real-time audit trail of all order events (created, paid, failed, etc.)

## Stripe Webhook

- Stripe webhook endpoint: `/api/webhook` (configure your Stripe dashboard to point to this for payment event updates)

## Real-time Features

- **Intelligent Polling**: Real-time notification delivery using efficient polling
- **Intelligent Polling**: Adaptive polling with exponential backoff for reliability
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with fallback error handling
- **Notification Filtering**: Filter notifications by type (order, credit, payment, system)
